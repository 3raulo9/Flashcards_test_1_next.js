const questions: Question[] = [
  { id: 1, question: "Can you explain the benefits of using TypeScript in a modern web development project?", answer: "TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early in the development process. It improves code quality and maintainability by providing clear type definitions. This results in better collaboration among developers and easier refactoring." },
  { id: 2, question: "How have you utilized React in your previous projects? Can you give an example of a complex component you built?", answer: "In my previous role, I used React to build a dynamic dashboard for monitoring key performance indicators. One complex component was a real-time data visualization chart that updated automatically as new data streamed in. It involved using hooks for state management and integrating with a WebSocket API." },
  { id: 3, question: "How have you implemented server-side rendering in a Next.js project?", answer: "I implemented server-side rendering in Next.js to improve SEO for a client's e-commerce website. By using getServerSideProps, I fetched product data from an API and rendered it on the server before sending the HTML to the client. This ensured search engines could index the content effectively." },
  { id: 4, question: "Can you discuss a project where you used Next.js to improve SEO and performance?", answer: "In one project, I used Next.js for a blog platform. By leveraging server-side rendering and static site generation, we significantly improved page load times and SEO rankings. Pages were pre-rendered with content, reducing the time-to-interactive for users." },
  { id: 5, question: "How does TailwindCSS streamline the styling process in web development?", answer: "TailwindCSS simplifies styling by providing utility-first CSS classes, which eliminates the need to write custom CSS for common styling needs. This approach promotes a consistent design system and speeds up development by allowing developers to apply styles directly in the markup." },
  { id: 6, question: "Can you provide an example of a project where TailwindCSS significantly reduced your development time?", answer: "I worked on a project to revamp a corporate website. Using TailwindCSS, I was able to quickly prototype and style components without switching contexts between HTML and CSS files. This accelerated the development process and ensured design consistency across the site." },
  { id: 7, question: "How do you ensure the accessibility and semantic correctness of your code?", answer: "I follow best practices such as using semantic HTML tags, providing alt text for images, ensuring proper color contrast, and using ARIA roles where necessary. I also run accessibility audits using tools like Lighthouse to identify and fix any issues." },
  { id: 8, question: "Describe your experience with building scalable UI components. How do you decide on the best-fitting technologies for a project?", answer: "I focus on creating reusable and modular components that can be easily maintained and extended. For scalability, I consider factors like project requirements, team familiarity with the technology, and community support. I often use a combination of React, Redux for state management, and TailwindCSS for styling." },
  { id: 9, question: "What strategies do you use to optimize a website for search engines?", answer: "I implement on-page SEO techniques like optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, and headers. I ensure fast load times using techniques like lazy loading and image optimization. Additionally, I use structured data to help search engines understand the content better." },
  { id: 10, question: "Can you explain how you would implement SEO best practices in a React/Next.js application?", answer: "In a React/Next.js application, I would use server-side rendering to ensure content is indexable by search engines. I’d also include relevant meta tags and structured data in the head section using the next/head component. Furthermore, I’d optimize the site’s performance by minimizing JavaScript and leveraging caching strategies." },
  { id: 11, question: "How do you balance aesthetics with functionality in web design?", answer: "I start by understanding user needs and the primary goals of the website. I create wireframes to outline functionality first, then iterate on design aesthetics to ensure they complement the user experience. I prioritize intuitive navigation and accessibility alongside visually appealing elements." },
  { id: 12, question: "Can you walk us through your process of designing a user-friendly interface?", answer: "My process involves user research to gather insights, creating personas and user journeys, designing wireframes and prototypes, conducting usability tests, and iterating based on feedback. This ensures the interface is intuitive and meets user expectations." },
  { id: 13, question: "How do you ensure that your designs align with user cognition principles?", answer: "I apply principles like Hick’s Law to reduce decision fatigue, use familiar design patterns to leverage user expectations, and ensure a clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention. I also focus on minimizing cognitive load by keeping interfaces simple and consistent." },
  { id: 14, question: "Can you describe a time when user feedback significantly influenced your design decisions?", answer: "In a project for a mobile app, user feedback revealed that the navigation was confusing. Based on this feedback, I simplified the menu structure and added clear labels and icons. Post-implementation, user satisfaction and engagement improved significantly." },
  { id: 15, question: "How do you keep the user experience in mind throughout the development process?", answer: "I regularly refer to user personas and journey maps to ensure that the development aligns with user needs. I conduct usability testing at various stages of development and use feedback to make iterative improvements, ensuring a user-centered design." },
  { id: 16, question: "Can you describe a situation where you had to prioritize features based on user needs?", answer: "In a project to build a new feature for a SaaS platform, I used user feedback to prioritize the most requested features. By focusing on these high-value features first, we were able to improve user satisfaction and retention rates." },
  { id: 17, question: "Describe a time when you took the initiative to improve a project without being asked.", answer: "In my previous role, I noticed that the website’s loading time was affecting user retention. I took the initiative to implement performance optimizations like code splitting and image compression. These changes reduced load times by 40%, leading to increased user engagement." },
  { id: 18, question: "How do you prioritize tasks when working independently?", answer: "I prioritize tasks based on their impact on the project’s goals and deadlines. I use tools like Trello or Jira to manage my workload, breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and setting clear deadlines for each." },
